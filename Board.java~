// The Board class defines a mxn grid, populated with Players, and
// the operations necessary for iterated prisoner's dilemma games in
// a particular environment.
// This breed of PD games permits Players in the grid to know the 
// outcomes of games within their spacial and temporal horizons.
// Players have memories and neighborhoods that they know something
// about, and base their decisions to cooperate or defect upon that
// information. 
//
// A Board is the environment on which they play, and the board
// implements the rules of the game.
